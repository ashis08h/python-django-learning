Access modifiers or access specifiers are in python used to limit the access of class variable
and class methods outside of that class.

There are three types of access modifiers.
1) Public
2) Private
3) Protected

Public -
By default all the variables or methods of a class are public.
Instance variables of a class followed by self (self.name) are public variables.

Private -
The variable name which start from double underscore (__name) are private. we can not
access those variables outside of that class directly.

Protected -
The variable name which start from single underscore (_name) are protected.
we can access those variables directly outside of that class. we use protected variables for
convention purpose in python code.
