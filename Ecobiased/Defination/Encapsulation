Encapsulation is a feature of oops where we hide the internal state of an object and the classes can
only be accessed or modified by object itself.

The benefit of encapsulation is we can protect our class to get accessed or modified via unwanted way.
we generally take help of access modifiers to encapsulate the internal state of an objects.
