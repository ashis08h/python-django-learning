when a class derived from a base class then the derived class inherits all the properties and
methods of the base class this is called inheritance. In addition the derived class may have their
own properties and methods.

There are 5 types of inheritance in python.
1) Single inheritance
2) Multiple Inheritance
3) Multilevel Inheritance
4) Hierarchical Inheritance
5) Hybrid Inheritance

Single Inheritance - This is a basic inheritance in which we inherit a class from one base class.

Multiple Inheritance - In this inheritance we inherit a class from multiple parent classes.

Multilevel Inheritance - In this inheritance we inherit a class from one parent class and from that
derived class also one more child class will be inherited.

Hierarchical Inheritance - In this inheritance we inherit multiple child classes from a parent
class.

Hybrid Inheritance - In this inheritance more than one type of inheritance use.
