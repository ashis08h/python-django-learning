Abstract class in python is a special type of class which can not be instantiated just use as
a blueprint to some base classes. we can make a class as abstract with help of ABC class from abc module.

Abstract methods will be a part of abstract class those methods will not have implementations in abstract
class, there implementation will be there in base class. We can make a method as abstract with help of
abstractmethod decorator.
