what is the difference between array and list in python?

    In python array is a data structure that store elements of same type in fixed size and take less
    memory than a list.

    The main difference between list and array are in array we can store similar type of element and
    in list we can store different types of elements.

    List has more property but it takes more memory than an array. Array has their fixed size it will
    not change, but list has dynamic size we can append elements, remove elements later also.

    To use array we need to import array first.

    from array import array

    my_array = array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4]) # Here i denotes the type of elements of array.
