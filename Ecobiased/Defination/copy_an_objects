In python we copy an objects by two way

1) Shallow copy
In shallow copy we create a new object from an original object but the element inside the copied object
will copy the references of original object elements.

That means if we change any immutable element inside a copied object the changes may get effect
in original objects also.

2) Deep copy
In deep copy we also create a new object from an original object and the element inside the
original objects get recursively copied to copied objects.
That means the copied objects will be fully independent from original objects.
