oops maps variables and methods with real world problems and it groups all the methods, variables
and all the logics together.

Class variables are defined as class level we declare the variable outside of any methods inside
the class. We generally store those value in class variables which are common to
all the instances. Each instance will use the class variables.

Instance variables are defined as object level. Each instance will have their own variable.
They are defined inside init method and usually store variable which is specific to each instance.
