Before we were using procedural programing where we used to write our logic inside methods.
then we have shifted to oops where we bring all the related methods together inside a class.
so in oops we write our logics inside methods and we keep related methods inside a class.
in oops our code is more organized way and the oops maps our variable with real world concept.
In oops we access the class methods, properties via objects.

There are some feature of oops -
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Inheritance
Method overriding
