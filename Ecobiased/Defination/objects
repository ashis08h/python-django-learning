Object is an instance of a class, which will have their own properties and it will use the methods
which is defined inside their class.

for example A person is a class which have some properties like name, age and some method like canSpeak()
canWalk() so each instance of that class will have their own name and age and all the instances
will have these two methods canSpeak() and canWalk().
