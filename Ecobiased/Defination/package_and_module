Both packaage and modules in python are used to modularize our codes.
modularize means reusable, modular, organized.
Module in a python are .py file which consists variable, methods and classes.
Basically we encapsulate the methods, classes or a variable inside a module and use those variable,
classes and methods after importing into the main script.
Modules also help us to avoid clashes between global variables.

example -
import module1


Package is a collection of modules. It used in bigger projects in which we group similar modules in
one package. __init__.py file will be there inside package.

new_package
  __init__.py
  module1.py
  module2.py
  module3.py
  subpackage
    __init__.py
    submodule1.py
    submodule2.py
    submodule3.py

example -
from package1 import module1
