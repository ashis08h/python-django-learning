Pickling and unpickling are the modules to serialize and deserialize the object in byte stream data
and vice versa.

To pickle an object will serialize the object into byte stream data and write into a file.
we use pickle.dump for pickling.
To unpickle a byte stream data will de serialize the byte stream data into an object.
we use pickle.load for unpickling
