Polymorphism is a feature of oops where we will have similar objects from different classes.
we treat the object of same common class. it also helps developers to write feasible code.

There are two types of polymorphism -

a) Compile time polymorphism
b) Run time polymorphism

Compile time polymorphism -

It is also known as method overloading where we have same name of objects with different number of
arguments. In python we have optional parameter concept to handle above scenarios.

Run time polymorphism -

It is also known as method overriding where we can define the method of parent class.
