1) What is procedural programing language.
2) What is Object orientation programing language.


Before we were using procedural programing language where we used to write logic inside methods.
then we have shifted to oops where we write our logics in methods but we keep related methods
and properties together inside a class. and we access the methods and the properties with help of
objects. Oops also maps our variables with real world concepts.

3) What is Class.
4) What is Object.

class is a blueprint of an object which will have all the properties and methods.
where properties are the data and methods are the action to be performed.

object is an instance of a class which will have their own properties and methods.
what are the methods which is defined inside a class their objects can use those methods.

For example Person is a class it has their properties like name, age, dob and some methods like
CanTalk(), CanWalk(), CanBreathe()
