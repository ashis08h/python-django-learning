In python unittest is a built-in testing framework which allows us to write and execute test
cases of the code. In python we have unittest modules to write test cases.

In unittest we create a test case class with unittest.TestCase class which contains all the test case
methods.

Test case methods are the individual test cases inside the test case class.

Assertion -
Assertion are the conditions or boolean expression in which should be True to pass a test case.
unittest.TestCase will give variety of assert methods like
assertTrue, assertEqual, assertFalse etc

Test Discovery

unittest will discover and run all the testcases by searching modules that
match pattern like 'test_*.py'.
