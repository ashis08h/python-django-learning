        a) A code editor
        b) Debugger
        c) compiler
        d) And other features that facilitate the development process.

2) What is Local IDEs?

    b) Requires manual steps and configuration.
    c) Limited to local system resource
    d) Hardware and OS dependent.

3) what is Cloud-based IDEs?

4) How to configure aws cli be using IAM user access key?
    1) Need to create a user in IAM with policies AdministratorAccess, AWSCloud9User,
        AWSLakeFormationDataAdmin

    2) After creating user need to create access key and store it in some notepad file
        AWS Access key and AWS secret key.

    3) These are the steps we need to follow after that in the windows terminal-
        $ aws configure
        AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIA5PEH5RQXD5R2KVD6
        AWS Secret Access Key [None]: tpd48HWGet1C38CxeIbeynn45k3cxpharlZBlub2/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
        Default region name [None]: us-east-1
        Default output format [None]: json

5) What is IAM?
    IAM - AWS Identity and Access Management
    whatever service we interact in the AWS, we are interacting with API. AWS has API for that.
    IAM basically provide the user, groups, role to an application to interact with AWS services
    through API. In IAM we can assign policies to a particular user to restrict or get access of a
    particular services of AWS.
    In shot form IAM authenticate a request(access/deny) in AWS.

    We can access AWS with three ways. -
    1) Using console
    2) Using cli
    3) Using API

6) How many types of user we have in AWS?
    There are two types of users in AWS
    1) Root user - which we create with help of email address during creating AWS account in the
        console. It is Full unrestricted

    2) IAM user - which we create in IAM services that can have friendly name like John + AWS Account
        ID or Alias. In this user We can add or remove IAM Policies as per requirements.
        Always advisable to use IAM users not root users after creating account, because in IAM user
        we can add policies to restrict unnecessary interacting with any services, but Root user
        can access all the services without any restrictions.

7) What is groups in IAM?
    The best way to assign a permission to a user through groups. We can create a groups having
    required permissions, later we can add assign users to a particular groups which requires same
    number of policies.

8) What is EC2 host and EC2 instance in AWS?
    EC2 is a regional service, for creating a EC2 instance we need to select a region.
    EC2 host are managed by AWS, and on top over virtual server we manage EC2 instance.
    Basically On the virtual server EC2 is an instance of a virtual server which have a certain
    number of cpu, ram and memory. Apart from this EC2 instance has an operating system such as
    windows, linux, mac os, etc on the top it we install our application and run whatever we need.
    we have full scope whatever we want to run on our virtual server.

    A selection of instance types come with varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage and networking.

9) What is AMI?
    AMI stands for Amazon machine image. An AMI defines the configuration of the instance.
    You can customize your instance and create a custom AMI.

10) What is EBS snapshot?
    A snapshot is a point-in-time backup of an instance.

11) What are the Benefits of Amazon EC2?
    Below are the following benefits of Amazon EC2 -
    1) Elastic computing - Easily launch hundreds to thousands of EC2 instances within minutes.
    2) Complete control - you control the EC2 instances with full root/administrative access.
    3) Flexible - Choice of instance types, operating systems, and software packages.
    4) Reliable - EC2 offers very high levels of availability and instances can be rapidly commissioned
        and replaced.
    5) Secure - Fully integrated with amazon VPC and security features.
    6) Inexpensive - Low cost, pay for what you use.

12) How to launch Amazon EC2 Instance in a public Subnet?
    Region -> VPC(Virtual private cloud) -> Availability zones -> (Public subnet)-> EC2 instance

    For an instance the data stored in EBC volume(Virtual hard disk) Elastic blob storage.

    We assign security groups also to control inbound and outbound traffic come or hit the EC2 instance,
    which behave like firewall to the instance.

    The Internet gateway enables the access form/to the internet.

13) What is key value pair in AWS EC2 instance?
    Key value pair in EC2 instance used to generate a public and secret key which is used to login
    into EC2 instance.

14) What are the EC2 instance connectivity options?
    a) SSH/Putty
        - supports for all the operating systems.
        - accessed by Terminal/CLI.
        - SSH daemon.
        - Uses instance key pair.
        - Port 22 must be open.
        - Anyone with key pair can access the instance.

    b) RDP
        - Supports for windows only.
        - Accessed by desktop/visual
        - Remote desktop service
        - Require RDP client
        - Port 3389 must be open
        - Need username and password to login

    c) EC2 instance connect
        - supports for all operating systems.
        - accessed by Terminal/CLI/Browser.
        - SSH daemon.
        - Temporary key pair.
        - Port 22 must be open.
        - IAM access control via policy.

    d) Session Manager
        - Supports for all operating systems.
        - accessed by terminal/CLI.
        - SSM agent.
        - IAM access control.
        - No port must be open.
        - IAM access control via policy.

15) How to RDP to windows machine?
    - Before RDP we need to add RDP in inbound security deposits.

16) How to connect other services from EC2 instance?
    There are several scenario where we connect other services to my EC2 instance such as
    storing data of my instance into database or some file storage.

    There are multiple ways to connect other services from EC2 instance -
    1) Using Access keys
        In this Access keys are associated with IAM user account and the account will have their
        policies. So the access key will be stored into the file system of instance and then
        instance will check if the user associated with that access key has permission to access
        other services or not such as s3 bucket, If that user has access then it will connect.
        This way is not very much secure because we are storing access key in the file system of
        instance. If any attackers attack to instances they can easily hack other services data also
        which is attached to that instance.

    2) Instance Profile -
        With help of IAM Role we connect the EC2 instance with other services.
        In this way we do not store any credentials into instance file system.
        This is pretty much secure way.

17) How to get the list of file storage directory or file list in the s3 bucket?
    aws s3 ls
    command to create a new bucket in s3
    aws s3 mb s3://mytestbucket34q3r3f4d

    when we connect with s3 using access key then after configure if we go to aws directory
    cd ~/.aws then in the credentials file we can see the access key and secret key in plain text
    which is un secure.

    rm -rf * to delete everything in a current dir.

18) How to connect EC2 with S3 bucket more secure way than access key?

    Since to connect EC2 with other services with help of access key is not secure we can go by
    role method.
    a) Create a role in IAM.
    b) Assign particular permissions as per requirement for example S3ReadOnlyAccess.
    c) Select the instance and assign role to that instance.
    Note - While creating Role we need to select EC2 in the use case dropdown.

    command to remove a bucket in the s3
    aws s3 rb s3://mytestbucket34q3r3f4d --force

19) What is VPC (Virtual private cloud)?
    A VPC is a logically isolated portion of AWS cloud within a region.
    Region - > VPC -> Availability Zones - Public subnet -> EC2 instance

    Subnets are created within Availability zones.
    An Internet gateway which is used to connect internet is attached to a VPC. 1 gateway per VPC.
    When we send signal outside to internet we call it Egress traffic.
    When we take signal inside from internet we call it ingress traffic.

    we can create multiple VPC inside an availability zone by default there are 5 VPC which we
    can create inside an availability zone but we can request to increase it.

    Each VPC has different block of IP address we call it CIDR IP Address where CIDR stands for
    Classless Inter domain routing.

    Each subnet has a block of IP Addresses from CIDR block.

20) What are the VPC components?

    Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - A logically isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud.
    Subnet - A segment of VPC's IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources.
    Internet Gateway/Engress- Only Internet Gateway - The amazon VPC side of a connection to
        the public Internet of IPV4/IPV6.
    Router - Router interconnect subnets and direct traffic between internet gateways, virtual private
        gateways, NAT Gateways and Subnets.
    Peering Connection - Direct private connection between two VPCs.
    VPC Endpoints - Private connection to public AWS services.
    NAT Instance - Enables Internet access for EC2 instances in private subnets managed by you.
    NAT Gateway - Enables Internet access for EC2 instances in private subnets managed by AWS.
    Virtual Private Gateway - The amazon VPC side of a virtual private network (VPN) connection.
    Customer Gateway - Customer side of a VPN connection.
    AWS Direct connect - High speed, high bandwidth, private network, connection from customer to AWS.
    Security group - Instance-level firewall.
    Network ACL - Subnet-level firewall.
