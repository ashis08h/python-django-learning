1) What is pandas?
    Pandas is an open source data analysis library written in python.
    
    It leverage the power and speed of numpy to make data analysis and preprocessing easy for data scientist.

    It provides rich and highly roboust data operations.

    Numpy is fast because it is written in c programming language and pandas uses the speed and power of numpy. So to do analysis with pandas is much faster than the python list, tuple, dictionary, array.

2) Why we use pandas for data analysis if excel sheet is already there?
    We use an external library pandas in python to analyse the data because in pandas we can use all the functionalities of python but in excel we can not. With help of pandas we bring the data into the code then it is easy to analyse the data.

    if we open large data file in excel then sometime it does not load the whole files.
    In the excel cells there is a limitation of data also.

In pandas in one column data will be uniform if we insert different data type inside a column then it will become object.

Pandas data structure.

    Pandas has two types of data structures:

    1) Series - It is a one dimensional array with indexes, It stores a single column or row of data in dataframe.

    2) Dataframe - It is a tabular spreadsheet like structure representing rows each of which contain one or multiple columns.

One dimensional array(labled) capable of holding any typeof data series.
A two dimensional data(labled) structure with columnsof potentially different data types of data - DataFrame

each column data type will be same inside a dataframe.

when we update a data of a column of a dataframe like df[0][0] = 'abc' then setting with copy warning will come.

newdf2 = newdf

view and copy

It means newdf2 is a view of newdf if you change any value of a cell in newdf2 then in newdf will that change will reflect just like shallow copy in the python.

Ex - new_df2 = new_df
    new_df2 = new_df[:]

when we do copy then it will behave like deep copy in python means if we change the element of copied dataframe then original dataframe will not change.

Ex - new_df2 = new_df.copy()

When we set some value of a cell by channing means df[0][0] then pandas will not confirm whether it will return views or copy because of this confusion it gives warning setting with copy warning.
To overcome with this warning we use loc method.

Ex - 
df.loc[0, 0] = 'ash' where first zero is index of the dataframe and second zero is column of the dataframe.
