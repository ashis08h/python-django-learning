1) What is pandas?
    Pandas is an open source data analysis library written in python.
    
    It leverage the power and speed of numpy to make data analysis and preprocessing easy for data scientist.

    It provides rich and highly roboust data operations.

    Numpy is fast because it is written in c programming language and pandas uses the speed and power of numpy. So to do analysis with pandas is much faster than the python list, tuple, dictionary, array.

2) Why we use pandas for data analysis if excel sheet is already there?
    We use an external library pandas in python to analyse the data because in pandas we can use all the functionalities of python but in excel we can not. With help of pandas we bring the data into the code then it is easy to analyse the data.

    if we open large data file in excel then sometime it does not load the whole files.
    In the excel cells there is a limitation of data also.

In pandas in one column data will be uniform if we insert different data type inside a column then it will become object.

Pandas data structure.

    Pandas has two types of data structures:

    1) Series - It is a one dimensional array with indexes, It stores a single column or row of data in dataframe.

    2) Dataframe - It is a tabular spreadsheet like structure representing rows each of which contain one or multiple columns.

One dimensional array(labled) capable of holding any typeof data series.
A two dimensional data(labled) structure with columnsof potentially different data types of data - DataFrame

each column data type will be same inside a dataframe.

when we update a data of a column of a dataframe like df[0][0] = 'abc' then setting with copy warning will come.

newdf2 = newdf

view and copy

It means newdf2 is a view of newdf if you change any value of a cell in newdf2 then in newdf will that change will reflect just like shallow copy in the python.

Ex - new_df2 = new_df
    new_df2 = new_df[:]

when we do copy then it will behave like deep copy in python means if we change the element of copied dataframe then original dataframe will not change.

Ex - new_df2 = new_df.copy()

When we set some value of a cell by channing means df[0][0] then pandas will not confirm whether it will return views or copy because of this confusion it gives warning setting with copy warning.
To overcome with this warning we use loc method.

Ex - 
df.loc[0, 0] = 'ash' where first zero is index of the dataframe and second zero is column of the dataframe.

What is the difference between loc and iloc in python?
    When we wanted to select an element based of the name of index and the column then loc will use and whenever we wanted to find an element with number of index it will start with 0 then we need to use iloc where it dooes not depend upon the name of the index or columns.


What is data science?
    Data science or data analytics is a process of analyzing large set of data points to get answers or questions related to that data set.

What is data munging or data wrangling?
    Process of cleaning messy data is called data munging or data wrangling.

What is dtaframe in pandas?
    Dataframe is a main object in pandas. It is used to represent data with rows and columns(tabular or excel spreadsheet like data.)

What are the different ways of creating dataframe?
    1) Using csv.
    2) Using Excel.
    3) From python dictionary.
    4) From list of tuples.
    5) from list of dictionaries.
    6) read_hdf
    7) read_sql
    8) read_json
    9) read_html
    10) read_stata
    11) read_sas
    12) read_pickle
    13) read_clipboard

fillna - To fill missing values using different ways.
interpolate - To make a guess on missing values using interpolation.
dropna - To drop with missing values.

In the interpolate method by default it is linear but we can use multiple things like quadratic, polynomial, cubic etc.
