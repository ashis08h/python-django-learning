1) What is pandas?
    Pandas is an open source data analysis library written in python.
    
    It leverage the power and speed of numpy to make data analysis and preprocessing easy for data scientist.

    It provides rich and highly robust data operations.

    Numpy is fast because it is written in c programming language and pandas uses the speed and power of numpy. So to do analysis with pandas is much faster than the python list, tuple, dictionary, array.

2) Why we use pandas for data analysis if excel sheet is already there?
    We use an external library pandas in python to analyse the data because
    a) in pandas we can use all the functionalities of python but in excel we can not. With help of
    pandas we bring the data into the code then it is easy to analyse the data.

    b) if we open large data file in excel then sometime it does not load the whole files.
    In the excel cells there is a limitation of data also.

In pandas in one column data will be uniform if we insert different data type inside a column then it
will become object.

Pandas data structure.

    Pandas has two types of data structures:

    1) Series - It is a one dimensional array with indexes, It stores a single column or row of data
    in the dataframe.

    2) Dataframe - It is a tabular spreadsheet like structure representing rows each of which contain
    one or multiple columns.

One dimensional array(labled) capable of holding any type of data series.
A two dimensional data(labled) structure with columns of potentially different data types of data
- DataFrame

each column data type will be same inside a dataframe.

when we update a data of a column of a dataframe like df[0][0] = 'abc' then setting with copy warning will
come.

newdf2 = newdf

view and copy

It means newdf2 is a view of newdf if you change any value of a cell in newdf2 then in newdf will that
change will reflect just like shallow copy in the python.

Ex - new_df2 = new_df
    new_df2 = new_df[:]

when we do copy then it will behave like deep copy in python means if we change the element of copied
dataframe then original dataframe will not change.

Ex - new_df2 = new_df.copy()

When we set some value of a cell by channing means df[0][0] then pandas will not confirm whether it
will return views or copy because of this confusion it gives warning setting with copy warning.

To overcome with this warning we use loc method.

Ex - 
df.loc[0, 0] = 'ash' where first zero is index of the dataframe and second zero is column of the dataframe.

What is the difference between loc and iloc in python?
    When we wanted to select an element based of the name of index and the column then loc will
    use and whenever we wanted to find an element with number of index it will start with 0 then we
    need to use iloc where it does not depend upon the name of the index or columns.


What is data science?
    Data science or data analytics is a process of analyzing large set of data points to get answers
    or questions related to that data set.

What is data munging or data wrangling?
    Process of cleaning messy data is called data munging or data wrangling.

What is dataframe in pandas?
    Dataframe is a main object in pandas. It is used to represent data with rows and columns
    (tabular or excel spreadsheet like data.)

What are the different ways of creating dataframe?
    1) Using csv.
    2) Using Excel.
    3) From python dictionary.
    4) From list of tuples.
    5) from list of dictionaries.
    6) read_hdf
    7) read_sql
    8) read_json
    9) read_html
    10) read_stata
    11) read_sas
    12) read_pickle
    13) read_clipboard

fillna - To fill missing values using different ways.
interpolate - To make a guess on missing values using interpolation.
dropna - To drop with missing values.

In the interpolate method by default it is linear but we can use multiple things like quadratic,
polynomial, cubic etc.

What is split apply and combine in pandas?
In pandas we have groupby function which is used to split the dataframe as per some column same as
groupby in sql then we have some aggregation functions such as max(), mean() which is used to apply
on the groupby objects. combine this whole process is known as split apply and combine.

What is pivot in pandas?
Pivot in pandas allows you to reshape or transform the dataframe.

What is pivot table in pandas?
Pivot table in pandas is used to summarize and aggregate data inside dataframe.
Similar to pivot table melt is used to transform or reshape the dataframe.

What is stack in python?

What is data analysis?
It is a process of deriving an insight from a dataset.
Basically in the real world data is very messy such as it has some typo, whitespace, may be
splitted into two columns or vice versa, So in this process we actually mold the dataset or we
can say shape the dataset in such a format on which we need it.

What is pandas?
Pandas is a powerful library of data analysis which built on the top of python programing
language. It is a robust toolkit for analyzing, filtering, manipulating, aggregating, merging,
pivoting and cleaning data.

What is series?
A python series is a one dimensional labelled array.
A series combines the best features of a list and a dictionary.
A series maintains a single collection of ordered values(ie a single column of data).
We can assign each value an identifier, which does not have to be unique.
When ever we do not tell pandas that specifically about the identifier of each values, pandas
automatically assign numeric values we called it index. It assign the values in the same order
as it is mentioned in the source list.

What is the difference between methods and the attributes?
Method is like a set of commands which we wanted to execute on the system.
attributes are like of properties of an objects ie attributes tells the information about the
objects.
for example we can tell a person to walk, talk, sleep these sets of commands are like of functions
of a person and name of that person, age, dob are like of attributes of that person which are like
some information about person.
An attributes does not require a parenthesis but a method require a parenthesis.

What are parameters and arguments?
A parameter is the name for an expected input to a function/method/class instantiation.
An argument is the concrete value we provide for a parameter during invocation.
