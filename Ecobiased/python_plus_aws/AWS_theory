1) What is AWS - Traditional vs cloud computing.
    Before when we wanted to launch a website we need to do few things before website development.
    First we need to purchase a server and keep into some garage, Server needs cool place so need to keep
    AC also. Our server should run 24 hours daily so need to hire a person for maintenance. Roughly we need
    almost 1lakh rupees to do above things before we develop my website.
    After above things still we have two major problem with this.
    a) Suppose we assume that 10 thousand person will come to my website at starting so we have purchased
        big server to maintain it but only 10 people are hitting my website so company will go in loss.
    b) Suppose we assume that 10 thousand person will come to my website at starting so we have purchase
        a server to maintain it but 10 lakh users are hitting my website daily so our website will crash.
    Now AWS came and he is saying that you develop your application and all the maintenance work i will
    handle for you. I will give you guarantee that your server will run 24 hours daily. Whenever you need
    more number of servers i will provide and whenever you need less number of server i can remove some
    server for you and i will take money for that much of hours or min or sec at which your server will run.
    This is called cloud computing benefit.

2) Cloud services
    There are three types of cloud services
    1) IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)
        Whenever all the hardware will be belongs to service provider and on that they will create a
        OS and provide that OS to us. We can decide what are the software platform we will install as
        per our requirements. This type of service is called Iaas (Infrastructure as as service).
        EC2 is an Iaas.

    2) PaaS (Platform as a service)
        In PaaS we use all the services of IaaS ie on the top OS we install some services and configure it
        also then we can sell those things to users with some more money that IaaS.
        In this service user will only manage their application and there data that's it.
        RDS is a service in AWS which based on PaaS.

    3) Saas (Software as a service)
        In SaaS Everything will be managed by service provider only. In this service the user data will
        be there with service provider only. Few companies do not use this service because of data issue.
        We use google email this is an example to SaaS where we do not configure or install it on the
        server.

4) Type of cloud.
    There are three types of cloud.
    1) Public cloud
        It is available publicly in the world for everyone. Anyone can use this cloud from anywhere
        and they can create their own resources their.

    2) Private cloud
        It is not available publicly for everyone in the world. We can use this cloud in company network.
        We can use public cloud and customize things and can make it as private cloud.

    3) Hybrid cloud
        It is a combination of public cloud as well as private cloud.

5) How AWS charge?
    AWS charge based on three things
    a) Compute - How many cpu, we use in AWS.
    b) Storage - How much storage we have used in AWS.
    c) Data Transfer - Download or Upload from outside.

6) Global infrastructure in AWS.
    In Aws three things are there
    Region - It contains number of availability zones.
    Availability Zones - It contains data centers.
    Data Centre - It is a physical block of storage of data.

    Region -

    Why AWS need multiple availability zones in the world why can't just make one availability zone
    in America or India and handle all the data from there?

    1) It depends on the number of audience present from which part of world. If we create keep our server
        near by the maximum audience place then it is easy to serve.

    2) Fore some government website government does not allow to place their data outside of the country.

    3) Disaster recovery - In case of any desaster such as flood, fire generally we keep a replica of
        one region into another region.
        All the region are connected through private network ocean wire. The speed of data transfer
        in it is 100 zb/sec.

    4) Cost effectivity - For example the cose of electricity is not same in USA as well as India.

    In AWS all the regions will have their name and code.
    It is not mandatory that all the services of AWS will be present in all the regions.
    cost of same services may change also region to region.

    Availability Zones -

    Why not we keep our data center at one region only why we have created availability zone?
