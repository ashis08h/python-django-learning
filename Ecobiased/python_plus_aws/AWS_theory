1) What is AWS - Traditional vs cloud computing.
    Before when we wanted to launch a website we need to do few things before website development.
    First we need to purchase a server and keep into some garage, Server needs cool place so need to keep
    AC also. Our server should run 24 hours daily so need to hire a person for maintenance. Roughly we need
    almost 1lakh rupees to do above things before we develop my website.
    After above things still we have two major problem with this.
    a) Suppose we assume that 10 thousand person will come to my website at starting so we have purchased
        big server to maintain it but only 10 people are hitting my website so company will go in loss.
    b) Suppose we assume that 10 thousand person will come to my website at starting so we have purchase
        a server to maintain it but 10 lakh users are hitting my website daily so our website will crash.
    Now AWS came and he is saying that you develop your application and all the maintenance work i will
    handle for you. I will give you guarantee that your server will run 24 hours daily. Whenever you need
    more number of servers i will provide and whenever you need less number of server i can remove some
    server for you and i will take money for that much of hours or min or sec at which your server will run.
    This is called cloud computing benefit.

2) Cloud services
    There are three types of cloud services
    1) IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)
        Whenever all the hardware will be belongs to service provider and on that they will create a
        OS and provide that OS to us. We can decide what are the software platform we will install as
        per our requirements. This type of service is called Iaas (Infrastructure as as service).
        EC2 is an Iaas.

    2) PaaS (Platform as a service)
        In PaaS we use all the services of IaaS ie on the top OS we install some services and configure it
        also then we can sell those things to users with some more money that IaaS.
        In this service user will only manage their application and there data that's it.
        RDS is a service in AWS which based on PaaS.

    3) Saas (Software as a service)
        In SaaS Everything will be managed by service provider only. In this service the user data will
        be there with service provider only. Few companies do not use this service because of data issue.
        We use google email this is an example to SaaS where we do not configure or install it on the
        server.

4) Type of cloud.
    There are three types of cloud.
    1) Public cloud
        It is available publicly in the world for everyone. Anyone can use this cloud from anywhere
        and they can create their own resources their.

    2) Private cloud
        It is not available publicly for everyone in the world. We can use this cloud in company network.
        We can use public cloud and customize things and can make it as private cloud.

    3) Hybrid cloud
        It is a combination of public cloud as well as private cloud.

5) How AWS charge?
    AWS charge based on three things
    a) Compute - How many cpu, we use in AWS.
    b) Storage - How much storage we have used in AWS.
    c) Data Transfer - Download or Upload from outside.

6) Global infrastructure in AWS.
    In Aws three things are there
    Region - It contains number of availability zones.
    Availability Zones - It contains data centers.
    Data Centre - It is a physical block of storage of data.

    Region -

    Why AWS need multiple availability zones in the world why can't just make one availability zone
    in America or India and handle all the data from there?

    1) It depends on the number of audience present from which part of world. If we create keep our server
        near by the maximum audience place then it is easy to serve.

    2) Fore some government website government does not allow to place their data outside of the country.

    3) Disaster recovery - In case of any desaster such as flood, fire generally we keep a replica of
        one region into another region.
        All the region are connected through private network ocean wire. The speed of data transfer
        in it is 100 zb/sec.

    4) Cost effectivity - For example the cose of electricity is not same in USA as well as India.

    In AWS all the regions will have their name and code.
    It is not mandatory that all the services of AWS will be present in all the regions.
    cost of same services may change also region to region.

    Availability Zones -

    Why not we keep our data center at one region only why we have created availability zone?
    Actually if we put data center in one region rather than availability zone then there will be few
    drawbacks
    1) What will happened if current cut shut down suddenly.
    2) What will happened if some terrorism happened.
    These are the scenario they would have consider for designing aws global infrastructure.
    Each availability zone will connect with different power house and with different network.
    Just like each region will have their unique code similarly each availability zone will have unique
    code.

    Local zones -
    When we wanted to keep my server inside a particular city in india, This time local zones will come
    into the picture.
    AWS say that if we keep our server inside local zones then in local zones it will give single digit
    latency to load the page. For now it is not necessary that all the services of AWS will be available
    to each local zones.

7) What is EC2 ?
    EC2 stands for Elastic compute cloud.
    EC2 gives us a server on rent. That means we can create a virtual machine on AWS EC2 service.
    While creating a virtual machine we can select multiple things such as

    1) Which operating system you wanted to choose.
    2) we can Select AMI(Amazon machine image).
    3) We can choose architecture of the virtual machine.
    4) We can choose instance type of that instance like t2-micro,etc.
    5) Can select existing security groups or can create new one.
    2) How many compute we need means number of cpu we need.
    3) How many RAM we need for my virtual machine.
    4) We can select speed of upload and download of data.
    5) Firewall rules we can add means which all traffic it allow.
    6) We can put bootstrap script while creating an instance. Which means whenever an instance will
       create first of all this script will run. For example Allocate IP to that instance, Add to
       DNS, Register in Iframe these kind of work we can add into bootstrap script or we can launch
       our whole application.
    7) How much storage we need for our server.

    While creating Instance we need to create key-pair.
    public key will goes to instance and private key we can store to access the instance after creation.

8) What is Inbound Rules and Outbound rules?
    Inbound means when we send request to server then on which port server will receive
    that comes under inbound rules.
    Outbound means where my server will communicate where he will give response.

9) How to access the ec2 instance?
    There are multiple ways to connect with the instances.
    1)
        I have accessed instance with help of ssh
        ssh -i <name of pem file> <username>@<public dns>
        by default username of a ubuntu machine will be ubuntu.
        at place of public dns we can keep public ip also in above ssh command.

        some time we get an error warning unprotected private key file.
        so here we need to assign read permission to only owner not anyone.
        AWS will not allow a pem file which is not private to access instance.
        chmod 400 <name of pem file>

        command to check os name inside instance -
        cat /etc/os-release
        command to check the ram of an instance
        free -m
        command to check the number of cpu we have in the instance
        lscpu
        command to check the storage available in instance
        df -h
        command to check private ip address
        ip a
    2) For windows machine where ssh will not work there we can use putty to access it.
    3) Using git bash.
    4) In instance list select a particular instance then click on connect button.
        go to ec2 instance connect tab and click on connect.
        In this way we did not need any tool to connect our instance we can connect in the browser only.

10) Default availability zone under mumbai region is ap-south-1a so how aws manage the load
    between all the availability zones?
    Basically for different user if we create server in same availability zone name then there
    is no guarantee that both are same availability zone.
    AWS point different availability zones having same name for different users.

11) Install NGINX in EC2 Instance and deploy sample application in Ec2.
    command to login as a root in an instance
    sudo -i
    command to update an instance
    apt-get update
    command to install nginx
    apt-get install nginx
    command to check the nginx configuration
    nginx -t
    command to check the nginx service status
    service nginx status
    command to check what are there in localhost ip in nginx
    curl localhost
    in /var/www/html directory by default index.nginx-debian.html file will be there.
    if we create index.html page with some content then if we do curl localhost
    it will load index.html page instead of index.nginx-debian.html file.

12) If we terminate an instance then by default EBS will get delete or not?
    Yes if we choose all the default value while creating instance then when we delete an instance
    EBS connected with that instance will also get deleted.
    While creating of ec2 instance we can configure also that after deleting an instance ebs storage
    should also delete or not.
    Need to go to advance option in storage configuration part select yes or no there.
    By default it wil be yes. That means if we delete an instance ebs will also get deleted.

13) How to configure user-data or bootstrap script for an ec2 instance?
    While creating an instance in advance option there is a text area where we need to write shell
    script for adding bootstrap script.
    when this instance will launch automatically bootstrap script will execute.

    sample shell script

    #/bin/bash

    apt-get update
    apt-get install nginx -y
    echo "I am Ashish Kumar" > /var/www/html/index.html

    The user-data script will always run as a root user not as a ubuntu user.

14) AWS Security Groups.
    It is a firewall which will place before the ec2 instance where we can write rules which
    port or which ip address's traffic will
    come or which traffic will not reach at the instance.
    We can write rules only for allow traffic rules not for denied traffic rules that means
    we can set rule such as ip address A can reach to ec2 instance ip address B can reach to instance.
    but we can not write rule such as ip address C can not reach the traffic.

    There are two types of rule Inbound rule and Outbound rule
    Inbound Rule - what traffic will reach to the instance. we can write such rule here.
        By default nothing will come.
        Here we can choose port as well as ip address to allow.
    Outbound Rule - What are the ip address or port on which the instance will give response.
        By default all traffic will come.

    ssh - default port 22
    Http - default port 80

15) Can we add more than on security groups to one instance?
    Yes
    We can change or add security groups to a running instance on the fly also.

16) How to add another security group to a running instance on the fly?
    1) Go to instance list page.
    2) Select a particular instance
    3) Click on action and select security
    4) Choose a security group and add that sg.

    Note - We can attach same security groups to multiple instance as well as we can add multiple
    security groups to same instance.

17) Instance Type.
    we can go to compare instance and compare the instance. we can increase or remove table column of
    instance also after going to settings symbol.

    example =
    t2micro - Here t is instance class 2 is generation of that class and micro is based on size.

18) Types of instance type?

    1) General purpose
        It is a balanced compute, memory and network bandwidth.
        example t2micro

    2) Compute Optimized
        where we need more cpu example for gaming purpose we can use it, where ever we need to generate
        more pdf we can use it.

    3) Memory optimized
